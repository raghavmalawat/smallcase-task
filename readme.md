NB:
- I am using a free tier of PostgreSQL and hence the application might be a bit slow. 
- The above doc contains some details regarding Domain Entities and Database entities along with future scope of enhancements and some coding strategies adopted. 
- I've added a list of 5 stocks and 5 Bonds as securities in the application (though this wasn't asked, I added for some consistency)
- I've added functional and line level comments for ease of understanding the codebase, if still one needs help, ping me.
